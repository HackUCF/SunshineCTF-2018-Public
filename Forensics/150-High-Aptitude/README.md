# [Forensics 150] High Aptitude

This is an image encoded in the Analog fax format known as APT, an older transmission format popular among weather satellites. In other words, this _is_ your Grandfather's stego challenge.

Upon realizing that the message is encoded in the APT format, it's trivial to decode the flag using any number widely available of scripts,
graphical applications, or specialized HAM radio software.

This challenge also comes with the added bonus of a red herring stego challenge, which is encoded within the provided WAV file, itself.
Upon decoding, the user will be presented with the "Stegwich of Failure", signifying to them that they should have gone with the more obvious, analog steganography solution.

The flag, as it appears in the decoded APT image, appears in the included image files:
- flag_bw.png
- flag_decoded_example.png

Note: Flag is in flag{...} format
