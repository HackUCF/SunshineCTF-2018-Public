I just invented the printing press, but my competitor developed a machine called BookWriter to assist with writing books. His machine allows you to write pages in any order you want, remove pages you don't want, and then publish the entire book. This new invention will bury my business!

I'd like you to do what you can to destroy his new machine. If you take over control of BookWriter and give me evidence, I'll give you a reward!
