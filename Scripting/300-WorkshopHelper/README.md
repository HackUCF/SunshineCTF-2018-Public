This is a scripting challenge for a web app. The intended solution is to use Selenium to automate answering the questions. The user will be asked to answer a series of questions. They will go through multiple stages where there will be multiple questions available. They have to answer a specific question in each stage. The specific question will be hinted at from a hint at the top of the screen. The hint will relate to the HTML element in which the question resides. Answer enough of the questions and the user gets the flag.
